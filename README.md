# HackNSlash

Our goal is to create a roguelike game in Unity. Here are our immediate objectives:

- [ ] Randomly-generated level
- [ ] Top-down camera which follows the player
- [ ] Enemies which spawn just beyond the camera

For now, nothing needs to look pretty. It just needs to function.

Bonus objectives once we complete the technical functionality:

- [ ] 2D-pixel or maybe 3D-voxel models for player, enemies, level
- [ ] Player and enemy health
- [ ] Player and enemy attacking
